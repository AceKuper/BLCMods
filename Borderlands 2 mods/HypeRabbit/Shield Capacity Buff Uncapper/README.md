Shield Capacity Buff Uncapper
=============================

As a result of how BL2 calculates shield capacity, percentage-based buffs (like those from Maya's Ward skill or a Protection Relic) give the same flat bonus to a high capacity shield (like a Turtle), that they'd give to a mediocre shield of the same level.  
A 10% buff, for example, would only be 10% if the capacity of your shield is under a certain threshold for its level. This threshold is quite low; most shields of green or higher rarity would exceed it.  
This mod aims to change that, allowing a buff to be accurate regardless of your shield's capacity.

All it does is move a few numbers around, but be aware: this mod affects every shield that isn't Rough Rider. If you use any other mods that change shield stats, they might conflict with this.

In fact, this mod overwrites some statements in the Unofficial Community Patch. I've merged conflicting statements into optional "compatibility" configurations for this mod, that you may choose from by importing this mod in BLCMM.  
These compatibility versions were made from UCP version 5.0.2.

Many thanks to apple1417 for teaching me how to mod, and helping me figure out all of the math for this mod.
