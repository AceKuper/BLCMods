Remove ADS Sway on Hot Mama
===========================

Are you an Anarchy Gaige? Did you hear about Hot Mama's perfect accuracy and try to snipe with it, only to find out that Gaige's arms are broken and your aim flails wildly? Or perhaps you're just looking for a gun more stable than the 3DS, so your character's hands will never jiggle while aiming.

Yeah, that's what this mod does. With this, when you're using Hot Mama and aiming down sights, your crosshairs won't sway around, even at maximum Anarchy stacks.

To get this mod to work right with Anarchy, I had to remove a small piece of Anarchy's accuracy penalty, so it's slightly less severe with every gun. The difference shouldn't be too noticeable, though. If you still want to leave Anarchy unchanged, you can disable that part of the mod. Doing so would make Hot Mama sway a bit at high Anarchy, but still nowhere near as much as in vanilla.
