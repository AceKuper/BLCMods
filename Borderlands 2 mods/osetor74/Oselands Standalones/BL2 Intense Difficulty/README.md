# [Intense Difficulty]

Replaces Badass Rank with a toggleable difficulty increase inspired by Wonderlands.

You can continue to earn badass tokens and redeem them, but any bonus you have from Badass Rank will not apply




## How to install mod

*This section will assume that you haven't installed a BL2 mod before. Feel free to skip steps if you have it set up already*

**If you are completely new to modding**, please watch **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57WxvASCX70&t=1s)** done by Apple1417 to install the PythonSDK. This is required for executing the mod in the game to apply its effects.

*You may also click [this link](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) for a written guide on how to install the SDK. Also leads to the video guide listed above.*


**Once you have all this setup, please right click the "IntenseDifficuly.blcm" file at the top of this page and save the file as new**


## How to make the mod work

Assuming you have followed the steps in the last section, you then need to execute the mod while in the main menu of the game.

Open your console
*(tilde by default when installing the PythonSDK. If you do not have a key that naturally creates a tilde then you should also install the Hex Multitool to manually set the console key to somethting else)*

Then type in "exec IntenseDifficulty.blcm" (assuming you didn't rename the file)

If the command shows as 'exec' and not 'say' then the mod works. Check the Badass Rank screen to make sure, though.
