============= [ Other Mods Included ] =============

	- Most of these mods are QoL mods that i believe make the game more fun/comfortable to play
	- Credits of those that made the mods can be found in the mod file if you open it with BLCMM


	- A large portion of the Unofficial Community Patch
		- Mostly the QoL and bug fix side of the patch, as well as most of the dedicated drop pool changes

	- Loot Midget World
		- Makes Loot Midgets spawn in almost every part of the game, instead of a couple specific ones
		  Has been tweaked a little bit for Oselands

	- No More Orders
		- Removes the need to have Doctor's Orders active to make loot midgets spawn in the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve

	- Better Fast Travel 
		- Opens all the one-way Fast Travel stations to work like all the other ones

	- More Chests on Pandora
		- Pretty self explanatory

	- UHD Elemental Sniper Fix (TURNED OFF BY DEFAULT, ENABLE WITH BLCMM)
		- fixes various problems with the UHD patch breaking skins




============= [ Global Changes ] =============

	> Stop scaling past 72

		- Added a system where nothing scales their stats past (by default) level 72. If you open the mod file with BLCMM, you can choose betwee
		  level 60, level 72, level 80 and reverting it back to vanilla OP10.

		- an OP7 gun or shield will have the exact same stats as an op0 variant, same with enemy base health and damage.
		  This means that you do not have to refarm items in OP levels at all. The items you get at the set threshold will carry you through every level.



	> Lower Scaling

		- The level scaling multiplier was lowered from 13% per level to 9% per level, which creates much lower numbers
		  Across the game. This shouldn't take away from the experience, instead it should make it so guns last longer
		  while leveling.



	> Enemy health changes

		- All enemy health was increased by 20% or higher, especially at higher levels.
		  (In compensation of changes to non-elemental, explosive and slag, and to generally make the game harder)



	> UVHM Rebalance

		- Enemy health was drastically reduced in UVHM, and slag is way less necessary.
		  The health of enemies in UVHM scales naturally the higher level you are, starting at 50 and capping at 60.
			This should make the entry to UVHM a bit smoother (or 'easier')
		-XP gain is increased after level 60 by 50%
		
		- Passive enemy health regen in UVHM was also removed and they passively take an additional 25% DoT damage.
	
		  (Do note that with the 'nerf' to slag, life steal or any other healing mechanic that relies on
		   a % of damage dealt is just weaker)



	> Element changes

		- Non-Elemental, Explosive and Slag naturally gain a multiplicative 1.2x damage buff, which increases to 1.4x in TVHM,
		  following the change to elements.

			- Shock's vs-Flesh and vs-Armor multipliers were also increased and follow a similar curve to NE/Explosive/Slag,
			  although it is a little lower just because it also has a DoT, which is a bigger focus in Oselands.


		- The duration of all fire/corrosive/shock status effects is now 5 seconds (instead of 5/8/2),
		  and removed shock DoT's inability to stack multiple times on the same enemy
			- This should make it so they are all much more consistent between each other


		- Enemy elemental resistances have been lowered so that you aren't penalized as much for using an unfavorable element.
		  However, there is still a noticable dip in damage, just not as big as before



	> Player scaling changes

		- Player health was increased by 20% to compensate for the NE damage changes

		- Player skill DoT damage was 'fixed' and is now more heavily used as well.


	> Slower enemy bullets

		- All enemy bullets' speed has been reduced to give you a slighty higher chance of being able to dodge them.
		- This affects rocket enemies the most, making them way more manageable.

		- Multiple options that you can choose from with BLCMM that change how much you want the bullets to be slowed by
			- Options for completely normal speed to -300% speed. Set to -200% by default.


	> Vendor changes

		- Rarities of items in gun and health vendors now become better depending on the level of the area; higher level = better
		- Multiple options that you can choose from with BLCMM that change the cost of ammo and health from vendors
			- Ranges from vanilla values to completely free; set to 25% of original cost by default

		- Purple items in vending machines have a 20% chance to be replaced by a blue/purple unique of the same weapon type



	> Miscellaneous

		- Backpack SDUs now provide +4 to backpack size instead of +3
		- Enemies give 20% more xp, quests give 40% more xp
		- Respec costs no money
		- Legendary rarity color was changed to be a bit darker
		- Vehicles now have 20% more health to compensate for the NE/Explosive/Slag changes



============= [ Relic Rework] =============

	> Random stats

		- Every non-unique relic in oselands now spawns with an additional randomised "Secondary Stat".
		  This can be anything from fire rate to reload speed to movement speed to elemental resistances to max health to- you get it.
			(the secondary stat can't be the same as the main stat of the relic, so max health on a vitality relic, for example)

		  This makes relics much more interesting and exciting to find, and more impactful from the very start.
		  The goal is that uniques(/ancients) would offer a new opportunity rather than just be better (this is a common theme with me)



	> Uniques

		(A small amount of movement speed = usually 15%)


		Vault Hunter's Relic
			-Now has 15% movement speed instead of the increased blue item chance.
			 This is supposed to just be a nice boost to make the very early game a bit more comfortable,
			 while not being powerful enough so you can throw it away when you find literally anything else


		Afterburner
			-Now comes with 25% movement speed (UCP)

		
		Moxxi's Endowment
			-Spawns with an additional secondary stat alongside its xp buff


		Deputy's Badge
			-Increases mag size for shotguns by a flat +2 after other bonuses, plus some shotgun reload speed


		Sheriff's Badge
			-Legendary Rarity
			-A large global fire rate buff (around the same values as vanilla, but not locked to pistols), and additional swap speed


		Otto Idol
			-Retains its health recovery aspect and the curse.
			 However, it is much more powerful (40-50% hp gained on kill at the highest levels) at the cost of a part of your max health


		Ranger Emblem (Replacing the Winter is Over relic)
			-Legendary Rarity
			-Has both a reload speed and mag size secondary stat

		
		Loaded Dice (Replacing Lucrative Opportunity)
			-Increases the chance for a world drop legendary by a little bit


		Blood of Terramorphous
			-Only drops in UVHM
			-Grants immunity to fire DoT, akin to a shield. Plus its normal health regen.


		Deathless
			-Massive boost to shield capacity and recharge rate
			-Health is drained while you are above 10% HP

		
		Blood of the Ancients
			-Unchanged


		Skin of the Ancients
			-Unchanged


		Bone of the Ancients
			-Same as vanilla, but with lowered numbers. However, it is still the only relic in the mod with both
			 elemental damage and cooldown rate, which can be useful.


		Heart of the Ancients
			-FFYL duration and life (vanilla), plus 30% increased critical damage.


		Wings of the Ancients (New)
			- 38-45% movement speed, with a secondary stat


		Shadow of the Seraphs
			-All of your shots with any gun gain +1 projectiles, at the cost of damage, fire rate and accuracy


		Might of the Seraphs
			-A huge amount of melee override cooldown rate, and a small amount of movement speed


		Blood of the Seraphs
			-Increased max health as well as some life steal


		Soul of the Seraphs (Replacing Breath of the Seraphs)
			-Increased cooldown rate and a small amount of movement speed
			-Reduces your shield's recharge delay by a flat 1 second, after other buffs

		
		Death Toll (Replacing Mouthwash)
			-Legendary Rarity
			-Increased kill skill duration, movement speed and fire rate
			-No longer has an interaction with the Toothpick


		Shaped Glass (Replacing Hard Carry)
			-Pearlescent Rarity
			-A massive gun damage boost, but halves your health
			-No Longer has an interaction with Easy Mode (Which was reworked)



============= [ Weapon Changes ] ============= 


	> Weapon Types/Manufacturers

		- I won't list every change like damage or fire rate differences, those can be found in-game. Just try different guns and see
		  how they feel.

			- Rarity changes
				- Mag size and accuracy buffs from rarities has been removed

				- In vanilla, the damage buffs from item rarities stacked with those from parts, which made +damage% parts
				  less effective. This has been changed so that it boosts *base* damage, which means it will be multiplicative
				  with those from weapon parts

				- The rarity damage increase has been changed from 24/48/72% to 15/30/45% for green/blue/purple
					(Guns are more consistently good, damage parts are a tiny bit more effective, and player power in general is a bit higher)


			- All base mag sizes for guns have generally been increased to compensate both for the previous change, as well as
			  the changes to matching grip bonuses (listed further down in the weapon parts section).


			- The assault rifle critical damage penalty was removed.


			- All bandit assault rifles, pistols and SMGs have 15% Double shot chance.
			- Removed the aspect from blue+ bandit ARs where they would get a damage and reload penalty in exchange for higher mag


			- Dahl pistols now have a base burst count of 3 while aiming, instead of 2
			- Dahl ARs now have a much shorter delay between bursts
			- Dahl snipers are now semi auto at all times, rather than having a burst while aiming


			- Hyperion guns have 10% increased base critical damage (2.2x instead of 2x)


			- Jakobs guns have 25% increased base critical damage (2.5x instead of 2x)


			- Jakobs and Torgue guns' damage were overall nerfed to compensate for the NE and Explosive damage changes
			  listed under Global Changes > Element Changes


			- Jakobs pistols have a chance to spawn with a Borderlands 1 Revolver style body, lowering their fire rate massively, while
			  increasing base damage, and base critical damage from 2.5x to 3x


			- Jakobs snipers are now always bolt-action, rather than semi auto for blue and purple+


			- Sniper rifle critical damage is calculated differently now, focusing more on base crit rather than increased crit
				- 3x base critical damage, 3.3x for Hyperion(+10%), 3.75x for Jakobs(+25%).	
					-These will show in game as +50%, +65% and +88% as the card value is comparing it to the base 2x multiplier.

			- Gemstone skins now increase something related to the manufacturer's special effects, intead of being a critical damage bonus for everything.
				Bandit gets increased double shott chance, Dahl gets increased burst count, etc.


	> Weapon Parts

		- Weapon parts and their manufacturers still keep their identity for the most part. Jakobs are still high damage, low fire rate,
		  tediore is low mag, quick reload, etc.

			- General

				- All vanilla matching bonuses were removed
					- Includes matching grip, matching barrel (a very small amount of damage), and special ones like
					  increased burst for dahl guns on dahl barrels and SMG/Sniper stocks

				- All parts (besides Vladof) now have some kind of small change to either DoT chance or DoT damage.
					- This is to create some small variety with the listed numbers on guns. Maliwan is still the king of DoT.

				- Some stocks have gained small stat buffs to hopefully allow for more diversity. These are supposed to be treated as
				  small bonuses, rather than a main focus. A nice extra.

				- Bandit and Torgue barrels and grips provide +25% Melee Damage.


			- Bandit
				- Barrels now have a mag size buff
				- Stocks now have a small mag size buff
				- Highest DoT chance after Maliwan


			- Dahl
				- Now have a small increase to damage rather than a damage penalty
				- Small increase to both DoT chance and DoT damage


			- Hyperion
				- Now provide critical damage at the cost of damage, and a small amount of bullet speed.
				- Highest DoT damage after maliwan


			- Jakobs
				- Increases damage at the cost of fire rate and mag size (instead of fire rate and reload speed)
				- Has a small DoT chance penalty


			- Maliwan
				- Grip only boosts DoT chance, and barrel only boosts DoT damage. Both are the highest of each category.
				- Now have a very small reload speed buff at the cost of a very small damage nerf

				-Stocks add 1 second to fire/corrosive/shock DoT duration while holding the gun


			- Tediore
				- Grips no longer have a damage penalty
				- Barrels have a sizeable reload speed buff
				- Stocks have a small reload speed buff
				- Has a small DoT damage buff


			- Torgue
				- Grips have a damage buff at the cost of reload speed and accuracy
				- Barrels have a small amount of increased mag size (Does not apply to ARs, since they use unique torgue barrels)
				- Stocks have a small damage buff
				- Has a small DoT damage penalty


			- Vladof
				- Barrels nerfed overall, as they were way ahead of everything else
				- Stocks have a small fire rate buff
				- Has no changes to DoT chance or damage



		- Accessories were more or less normalized across every weapon category (with some exceptions, particularly shotguns and
		  launchers).

			- Accessory_None can't spawn on Blue rarity Unique guns anymore (as well as the Longbow and the Infinity)

			- Bayonets now function similarly to shotguns' "General Boost" accessory, and the original shotgun accessory
			  was replaced with something else. They still retain the +50% Melee Damage boost.

			- Bullet Speed and Accuracy accessories were generally combined into one, and they all have additional fire rate at the cost of
			  a small amount of reload speed (i.e Flying for dahl SMGs or swift for vladof ARs)

			- Stability prefixes now have additional critical damage

			- Assault Rifle Accuracy accessory has been replaced with a double accessory, mimicing the pistol double accessory
				-Includes new prefixes

			- Rocket Launcher Accuracy accessory has been replaced with a ""BFG"" accessory, acting as a stronger variant of the
			  Damage accessory, but doubling the ammo per shot.
				-Includes new prefixes

			- The shotgun vertical grip accessory was heavily nerfed, now providing a +35% increase to pellet count rather than
			  +2, and with a fire rate penalty.

				-(for some guns this can be a buff, mainly high pellet shotguns like a ravager)

				- the accessory, alongside any other part that just wouldn't work on a particular gun (like crit on a splatgun)
				  has been removed from the part lists of that gun

			- SMGs accuracy accessory was replaced with a mag size accessory
				-Includes new prefixes




		- Effects of the changes  (developer notes)

			- The purpose of these changes have been to try to make the guns you find and pick up much more appealing, and  finding a
			  "good gun" is much easier. There will naturally be something better, but the gap in power should be smaller. This also means
			  that you, the player, is just naturally better regardless of what you pick





		- Gun additions / other changes

			- Jakobs and Torgue shotguns now have unique E-Tech barrels, creating the Tracer and Carnage (works like the pearlescent
			  shotgun, with some tweaks, and said pearlescent shotgun was entirely reworked)

			- E-Tech Dart pistols now have high fire rates, and don't consume 2 ammo per shot
			- Torgue pistols now have a unique E-Tech barrel, creating the Carbuncle

			- Snipers' E-Tech barrels are now divided into Splitters and Railguns, Vladof & Dahl / Maliwan & Hyperion respectively.
				-Mimics the laser types from The Pre-Sequel with the same names



		- Shield changes

			- Non-Unique Amp shields were completely reworked
				-No longer have a traditional Recharge Rate, instead recharges to full instantly when the Recharge Delay is over
				-Capacity has been generally lowered to compensate due to this.
				-The damage has been looked over to hpefully make them more appealing to use

				*- These changes were made to hopefully make amp shields a bit more unique compared to everything else,
				   and give you an opportunity to use the amp damage more
			
			- Absorb shields' base absorb chance was increased by 10%

			- Non-Unique Roid shields now provide increased max health. these values are identical to adaptive shields.

			- Non-Unique Spike shields' damage was tripled

			
			- Shield parts have been completely rebalanced, TL;DR:

				- The shield parts generally keep their identity compared to vanilla, with exceptions

				- Special penalties have been removed, and maliwan's increased special has been slightly lowered.
				  However, it still has the highest +Special

				- Dahl parts now serve as a general-use part, giving a nice boost to the main 3 stats while not affecting special in any way

				- Vladof parts now give a passive 10% movement speed each

				- Maliwan capacitors were reworked to not share stats with other maliwan parts,
				  so the main focus of those parts are the elemental immunities.
			



============= [ Drop Changes ] ============= 

	> Rarity odds

		- TL;DR  white less common, purple and legendary more common

		- VeryCommon weight lowered from 200 to 100
		- Common weight lowered from 100 to 60
			
			- Both of the above get reduced down to half of their values between levels 30 and 80

		- Legendary weight increased from 0.01 to 0.0667. This gets increased by 20% for each OP level,
		  up to a tripled value (~0.2)

		- VeryRare weight increased from 0.1 to 0.25


		- Legendary weight is doubled in the following areas:
			Digistruct Peak
			the 3 Circles of Slaughter
			Leviathan's Lair
			Torgue's Arena (the big one in his DLC)


	> Dedicated legendary drop changes

		- Most UCP dedicated pool changes have been ported over to Oselands

		- Head and skin drops have been removed from dedicated legendary pools entirely

		- Any dedicated pool with more than 1 item in the pool has had its chance multiplied by the amount of items in the pool,
		  meaning that any individual item in the pool generally has a 10% chance of dropping, rather than having
		  10% split between all of them

		- Legendary shield pools not world dropping properly has been fixed
		- The 6 "new" legendary relics added in the mod are now part of the world drop pool


	> UCP quest


	> Raid Boss Legendary Drops

		- Legendary world drop weight is multiplied by 3 in Terramorphous's Peak and the Winged Storm (dragons of destruction map)

		- Hyperius, Master Gee, Pyro Pete and Voracidous now all have 4 individual pools with 6.67% drop chance each every kill which
		  drop a random world drop item from the legendary pool of guns, shields, grenades and class mods respectively.
			This chance increases by 20% for each OP level, up op to a tripled value

		- Voracidous now has a 25% chance to drop a random Gen2 Legendary Class Mod

		- Dexiduous now drops 5 guaranteed legendaries every time you kill it, and an additional 5 chances of ~13% each that scale with OP levels


	> Knuckledragger

		- Now drops a random white rarity pistol instead of always dropping a jakobs pistol

		- The chest after knuckledragger now gives a random white rarity shotgun, in addition to a random white rarity AR, SMG or sniper



	> Golden Chest

		- Made it cost 20 Eridium, instead of golden keys

		- Now throws out 3 items in front of it, instead of spawning items within the chest itself
			- This also had the side effect of bypassing the need of watching the entire chest opening/closing animation to re-open it

		- Now also gives you gemstone guns, legendaries, and blue-rarity class mods (since they are actually good).



	> Tubbies

		- Gen1 Pearlescent guns have been removed from the Tubby pearlescent pool, and the base chances have been increased
		- The tubby pearlescent pool now also scales with Overpowered levels again:

			OP Level
			0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9     10
			10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 21, 25, 27.5, 30

		- This makes it so it's way less unforgiving. Also means that OP levels are more appealing, especially higher ones,
		  and makes 9 and 10 a smaller optional bonus.


		- Tubbies now have a 20% chance to drop an additional world drop legendary, similar to loot midgets' 15%


	> Witch Doctors

		- Now have a ~3.3% chance to drop a world drop legendary. This is doubled for badasses
		- Scales with OP levels, up to a tripled chance

	> Omnd-Omnd-Ohk

		- Now has a 3% chance to spawn instead of 1% (tweaked UCP)
		- Twister is now a guaranteed drop


	> Uranus / Cassius

		- The overall chance to drop legendaries was heavily reduced, though it still exists in a small capacity to keep an essence of vanilla


	> Jimmy Jenkins / Loot Goon Goliaths / Muscles

		- All 3 of these enemies now have gotten additional legendary drop chances seperate from world drop chances,
		  on top of UCP making jimmy jenkins function like a normal loot midget


	> Haderax Chests

		- The chances for legendaries have been toned down to match the other raid bosses in the mod
		- The previously digi peak set items now have a 10% chance of spawning in their respective chests
			- Now basically acting as dedicated drops, and 'honors' their pearlescent rarity a little better

		- Now provide a somewhat even spread of the different types of items


	> Mimics

		- Now have a ~5% chance of dropping a world drop legendary. Scales with OP levels, up to a tripled chance
		- 66% chance of dropping a random Dragon Keep class mod



============= [ Enemy Changes ] ============= 

	> Raid Bosses

		> All raid boss health (except dexi) has been reduced. Some of them by *very* substantial amounts.
			- Partially due to the nerfs to the Bee shield. But also to hopefully make it way more flexible to use different kinds of items.

			- Voracidous's shield is lowered, but only in UVHM. I have not figured out how to lower it in the other 2 difficulties yet.

			(While not a raid boss, these changes also applies to Badassasaurus Rex because fuck that enemy lmao)

		> Master Gee

			- Now has a 98% resistance in his initial phase instead of a complete immunity
			- Absorbing an acid puddle reduces resistance by 20%, applies to both Gee and yourself

			- These changes should make it so you have way more flexibility in how you approach the fight by giving
			   you the ability to deal damage as well, while keeping the gameplay of trying to lure him to the acid puddles
 


============= [ Vault Hunters ] =============

	> Overview
		- Overall, characters are just better in every single way, both damage and survivability. With some exceptions.
		- An overarching goal has been to give more opportunities to give said damage and survivability, spreading the sources for each around

		- Every character has a 'passive bonus' for each of the 3 branches in their skill trees;
			Every time a skill reaches 5 points, you gain some buff that is shared across every skill in that branch
			This effect stacks for each skill you get to 5 points

			Works if class mods boost skills to 5/5 or higher

			Certain skills with a specific pre-requisite need to do that pre-requisite to get the passive effect as well.
				This includes every kill skill as well as things like Battlefront and Wreck.
				However, there also isn't any specific pattern to it.

============= [ Unique Items ] =============

	> Now, this will not be a full list of all the changes to every unique item. That would be a really long list, and
	  i still want to keep some semblance of discovery. This part is here more for what you can expect. Some examples.


	  Every unique gun has been looked over in some way. Some guns did not change at all, or in very small ways. Some guns were nerfed/buffed, some guns were
	  readjusted to be closer to what they were in vanilla after indirect changes like through weapon types. A lot of guns were given a new identity,
	  such as the Patriot now being a very slow, but high damage and high-mag vladof sniper. Some guns were replaced, like Seraphim being replaced with
	  the Destroyer from Borderlands 1, making it a Dahl assault rifle that functions like a chopper when aiming down the sight.

	  The power of each gun was, of course, looked over, and hopefully more things are more powerful than what they used to be.
	  Try things out, use things you wouldn't otherwise. I especially recommend trying the items that are basically memes in vanilla.


	  A lot of unique guns were given a new visual barrel to hopefully give some variety in the look of uniques within a weapon type.
	  To give that feeling of "oh, this is different."


	  Also, yes, the Grog is nerfed.
