=============== [ 1.1.4.1 ] ===============

	- Added a thing in the last update to apply the slower enemy bullet stuff to No-Beard's stinkpot
		- What i did didn't work, but it's fixed now


	- Removed Hyperion pistols from the E-Tech pistol pool
	- Removed E-Tech barrels from the standard purple-rarity, and gemstone, Hyperion pistol partlist	
		-Hyperion has a passive crit bonus, and the E-Tech barrel negates it.
		 Plus, Hyperion E-Tech pistols don't really do anything the other manufacturers can't


	- Fixed Aggression Relics not getting their main stat properly (gun damage or fire rate)

	- Fixed health regen effects on relics not working
	- Fixed Moxxi's Endowment not being able to get a Max Health secondary stat


	- Fixed Bad Maw not properly dropping the Daedalus Hyperion SMG

	- Made it so the chance for the Warrior legendary loot pool is 100% even outside of the story kill
		- Further emphasizing the lack of need to Read-Only farm and whatnot

	- Fixed Handsome Sorcerer being able to drop the Fate, since it was in the Warrior loot pool
		- Now instead it's a separate 10% chance from the warrior, ignoring the change above this

		(i had given the Handsome Sorcerer its own drop, so i didn't want you to only need to farm that one enemy to get both)



=============== [ 1.1.4 ] ===============

	- An update to the XP & Level Controller systems in the mod
		- Fixed some player scaling stuff not working properly if you kept the level threshold at 80op10
		- Fixed XP multiplier after level scaling not working properly
		- Overall simplified the whole system


	- Massively boosted the drop chance of blue and purple uniques that were given drop locations by UCP
		- Farming quest rewards is dumb. This change makes it so each of these drops (with some exceptions) practically have a
		  100% chance of dropping, because that is the chance you would have while farming a quest.
		- This chance is broken up into 2 chances (80% and 20%), meaning you have a near 100% chance of getting at least 1, but
		  a small chance (~16%) of getting 2 in the same run.
		

	- Added an additional random legendary chance to mimics
	- Mimics now have a high chance of dropping a random Tina DLC class mod on death

	- Made the additional legendary drop chances given to Son of Crawmerax by the UCP properly scale with the legendary weight in OP levels
		(up to tripled chance at OP10)

	- Added an additional random legendary chance to raid bosses in addition to their chances for specific types of legendaries

	- Replaced the Sand Hawk reward from Whoops with a random purple gun
	- Added Sand Hawk as a reward to Treasure of the Sands (the repeat of the final quest. This quest is repeatable thanks to UCP)

	- Removed drops below blue rarity from the chests in The Leviathan's Lair


	- Brought over UCP change of fixing a lot of red texts being an incorrect, more intense color



		== Unique item changes ==


	- Added a *new* Legendary Hyperion shield: Ankheg
		- Great shield capacity, increased max health
		- ignores the shield recharge rate/delay system entirely.
		  Instead it has an always-active shield regeneration rate mechanic, affected by shield parts that affect shield recharge rate


		- 10% drop chance from the Black Queen, and also is in the world drop legendary shield pool


	- Highly increased damage of the Badaboom
		-After doing some basic math, the damage with all 6 rockets combined was less than the single rocket that normal bandit launchers fire
		-Now, if you hit all 6 rockets, it will deal more total damage.


	- Increased the damage and magazine size of the Butcher

	- Reduced the rocket speed of the mongol slightly and made it unable to spawn with parts that would increase its rocket speed


	- Reworked the Shaped Glass pearlescent relic
		-Now affects most types of damage instead of just gun damage, and it's in a different part in the damage formula. Meaning it's even stronger.
		-Instead of giving a -100% max health debuff, it now doubles all damage taken from enemies.


	- The Unmaker now consumes 2 ammo per shot, but deals more damage

	- Increased gun damage and crit damage of the Unforgiven, but made it consume 3 ammo per shot

	- Changed Retainer to legendary rarity and made it drop in the legendary world drop pool



=============== [ 1.1.3 ] ===============

	- Increased base shield capacity and recharge rate by 20%, to match the boost that player health got

		- I am fully aware that this might be overkill, because the mod hasn't had it before this and so wasn't balanced for it either.
		  But for consistency, i want to try it out

		- Player health was increased as compensation for elemental changes (mainly the non-elemental, explosive, slag and shock changes)


	- Fixed incorrect dedicated legendary chances on the four assassins, Hyperius and Handsome Sorcerer

	- Fixed some things not working with the level threshold system
		-Environmental damage (barrels, frozen water)
		-the damage done by the default grenade when you have no mod equipped
		-Vehicles


	- **Massively** reduced the health of Dexiduous the Invincible
	- Increased the damage dealt by the explosions when you pop the zits on Dexiduous

	- Added additional legendary chances to Dexiduous so that it creates a large lootsplosion on death
		- The thing is so annoying to kill and get to even with the changes above, i figured you should be rewarded for the time you put into it


	- Gave Witch Doctors in both the Big Game Hunt DLC and Son of Crawmerax Headhunter DLC 
	  a highly increased chance to drop legendaries. This is further increased for badass variants


	- Reworked the loot gained from the chests after you kill Haderax
		- The chances for legendaries have been toned down to match the other raid bosses in the mod
		- The previously digi peak set items now have a 10% chance of spawning in their respective chests
			- Now basically acting as dedicated drops, and 'honors' their pearlescent rarity a little better

		- Now provide a somewhat even spread of the different types of items




		== Unique item changes ==

	- Changed the Funk Popper (replacing Unicornsplosion) to legendary rarity and added it to the world drop legendary shotgun pool

	- Fixed Nirvana not having the proper stats on its body
		-This results in a slight reduction to damage and mag size

	- Improved the skin of the Infection Cleaner, Retainer and Bulwark of Purity (replacing Easy Mode) to match the other changed rainbow skins

	- Fixed Retainer's description elements being in the wrong order

	- Peak Opener
		- Renamed to Unmaker
		- Now is pearlescent rarity
		- Added to the Gen1 pearlescent AR pool


=============== [ 1.1.2 ] ===============

	- Removed error messages on subsequent executions of the mod that cloned objects already exist
		- Theres still some errors about skill effects relating to the ogre? i removed the behavior of the ogre so i have no idea why they appear

	- Added tags in the mod file that make the mod look better when executing the mod through the Text Mod Loader  mod by apple1417


		== Unique item changes ==

	- Fixed an issue with the Fate sniper rifle that caused it to sometimes have 0 ammo in its mag


=============== [ 1.1.1 ] ===============

	- Fixed some of the loot pool changes from the previous update not taking effect
		- Legendary drops were essentially triple their intended value, and the skins weren't properly removed from the general pool

		- I thought this was important enough to make an update on

	- Was experimenting with increasing the XP gained from completing the quest Cleaning Up The Burg,
	  and i left it in because why not


=============== [ 1.1.0 ] ===============


	- *Completely new Legendary items*
		-I was going to put these in the unique item changes section at the bottom, but this is important enough to break the rules

		- Added 12 completely new legendary weapons.
			- The descriptions of these guns can be found in the Changelog text file, in the unique guns section.

			- Available in the world drop pools, dedicated drops listed below:

		> Rupture (Bandit AR) - Wilhelm
		> Swordfish (Jakobs AR) - Assassins

		> Sigil (Tediore Launcher) - Only from Hyperius the Invincible
		> Blitz (Vladof Launcher) - Bunker

		> Patience (Jakobs Pistol) - World Drop Only
		> Orb of Storms (Tediore pistol) - Handsome Sorcerer

		> Beartrap (Bandit shotgun) - Der Monstrositat
		> Tigris (Jakobs shotgun) - Sheriff of Lynchwood

		> Laser (Sub)Machinegun (Dahl SMG) - Ol' Slappy
		> Daedalus (Hyperion SMG) - Bad Maw

		> Fate (Dahl sniper) - Warrior
		> Gubber (Vladof sniper) - Laney White

		-None of these have their own unique skins. If i ever decide to update Oselands again, i might give them new skins.

	

	- Added a system where player, enemy and item stats do not scale after a level threshold.
		
		-i.e a level 73 gun would have the same stats as an op10 version with the same parts.

		-This threshold is by default set to 72, and has options for reverting back to vanilla op10, level 80 and level 60.

		-Setting the threshold to 80 or below means that you do not have to refarm in OP levels, which can make the
		 experience more enjoyable.

		-Enemies not scaling past a point also means that health doesn't get to scale as high past the player. Which
		 means that the enemies can be easier than if they scaled like in vanilla.
			-Level 60 items against level 60 enemies will be a bit easier than level 80, without even mentioning
			 that you get more skill points, essentially scaling past the enemies instead of the other way around.

		-Each option also has multiple sub-options for increased XP gain after the set threshold.
		 By default this is set to 1x, the same as before this update, with additional options for 3x and 5x
		 xp gain after the set threshold.


		-A small problem: the default grenade seems to ignore this entirely, so its damage keeps scaling past the threshold



	- Additional changes to overall loot acquisiton and chances, aiming to make loot drops better/more rewarding while still keeping it fair

		- Added an option to increase dedicated legendary chances.
			-Options for 10% (vanilla), 15% and 20%. Set to 10% by default.


		- Increased the chance for the "standard enemy guns and gear" pool to drop from 8.5% to 15%
		- Removed skin drops from said pool (they were essentially just taking up item drops)

		- Made VeryCommon and Common weights get reduced down to half their value between levels 30-80 instead of op0-op10

		- Increased Legendary weight from 0.025 to 0.0667 (still gets increased by 20% per OP level, up to a tripled value at OP10)
			(Vanilla 0.01)

		- Purple items in vending machines have a 20% chance to be replaced by a blue/purple unique of the same weapon type
			-Should give more opportunities for people to experience items they usually wouldn't


		- Brought down legendary multiplier in Terramorphous Peak and Winged Storm from 5x to 3x again, as i increased the legendary weight in general
			- The final chances will still be higher than before


		- The additional legendary chances from Raid Bosses as well as Muscles, Jimmy Jenkins and Loot Goon Goliaths were increased to 6.67% from 5%,
		  as a part of that increase to the legendary weight. Retains the OP level scaling.
			(At OP10 this will mean a 20% chance for those drops)



	- Rework to the Golden Chest in Sanctuary

		- Made it cost 20 Eridium, instead of golden keys

		- Now throws out 3 items in front of it, instead of spawning items within the chest itself
			- This also had the side effect of bypassing the need of watching the entire chest opening/closing animation to re-open it

		- Now also gives you gemstone guns, legendaries, and blue-rarity class mods (since they are actually good).



	- Halved status damage done against the player
	- Doubled movement speed while in FFYL

	- Halved the speed of dragons in the TTAoDK DLC areas, including the dragons of destruction


	- Removed the possibility of elemental resistance secondary stats spawning on all relics
		-I felt that they weren't as appealing as other secondary stats, and making the values too high could have consequences i can't think of

		-Maybe i will re-attempt it with like a universal resistance stat instead of one for each resistance type. I don't know

		-I did not entirely delete the parts, so any relics you would've had that has the stats will still have them.
		 Assuming you have Sanity Saver. Which you should, if you're playing Oselands.


	- Reworked/Fixed Resurgence's healing effect to now be 50% of your max health healed over 1 second
		(the skill just wasnt working properly before)

	

	- Removed minimum level requirements from non-launcher white rarity weapon pools
		- Now you can get every type of item right off the bat. Besides rocket launchers for obvious reasons

	- Removed minimum level requirements from all white rarity shield pools
		- No more are you locked to just tediore shields at the start of the game

	- Replaced Knuckledragger's white jakobs pistol drop with a random white rarity pistol

	- Made the chest right after Knuckledragger give you a random white rarity shotgun (instead of always being jakobs)
	  and a random white rarity AR/SMG/sniper (one of those 3)



		== Unique item changes ==

	- Added 3 'new' legendary relics (aka recycled unused items given a new coat of paint).
		-Available in the world drop pools


	   Including this here as i consider them pseudo-uniques:
	- Highly increased the damage of the Carbuncle e-tech torgue pistol
		-I managed to use these during playthroughs and compared to other e-tech weapons of similar levels and they were 
		 super underperforming for their ammo cost and just weren't fun to use. So, here is a change to that

	- Prazma Cannon
		- Massively lowered the speed of the main projectile
		- Highly increased the explosion radius of both the main projectile and child projectiles
		- Made the main projectile's explosion deal 50% more damage


	- Reworked Cobra
		- Now fires a torgue gyrojet-esque projectile with a massive 200% damage explosion when it hits something (still remains as "gun" splash)
		- 3 Ammo per shot, much higher base damage, essentially removes base crit multipliers
		- It's supposed to be more like a rocket-firing rifle than a sniper rifle


	- Increased the chance for the TMNT rats to drop a storm front from 2.5% to 5% (same as what UCP did)
	- Doubled the chance for the Thunderball Fist to drop from Captain Flynt and Sparky Flynt

	- Removed the possibility of vertical grip accessory spawning on Jolly Roger

	- Removed Flicker from the Legendary Siren class mod

	- Removed the possibility for the morningstar skill effect to stack



=============== [ 1.0.7 ] ===============

	- Added a toggle in the mod file that removes FFS content from the rest of the game, in case you don't have the DLC.

	- Reduced enemy damage by ~10% when you are in TVHM or UVHM, to compensate for elements as a whole becoming stronger
	- Fixed up enemy damage in UVHM to scale between levels 50-60 to then regain that damage back
		TVHM (especially the very start) was a very unexpected difficulty spike, unintentionally high.
		This means that endgame balance should be about the same as it was before, and TVHM still being harder than the end of normal mode,
		but should ease that transition a little bit


	- Increased XP gained from quests by 40%
		Even higher than what enemy XP got to incentivize doing quests and, much like increasing enemy XP, makes the story experience smoother

	- Increased XP gain by ~1.5x in UVHM after level 60
		This is an additional multiplier that applies to both enemies and quests
		Makes the post-story XP grind even easier


	- Fixed Flicker on Maya so that it also applies to other skills in the skill tree that apply their own Damage over Time effects (Smite, Backdraft, Cloud Kill etc)
	- Reduced Player Skill DoT by ~25% to compensate for the change above. But now you can boost flicker even further, making those skills even better
		Unfortunately, i can't do the same for Gaige's DoT skills, as that would end up making Electrical Burn get those buffs twice.
		So Shock and AGGGHH- can not benefit from those effects

	- Renamed Backdraft on Maya to Discharge to better suit the new effect the skill has in Oselands


	- Integrated the Loot Midget World mod into Oselands, originally created by Mopioid
		Makes Loot Midgets spawn in a lot more areas in the game, rather than being confined to a handful ones.
		Mod has been tweaked a little bit to fit better in oselands, namely removed a few possible spawn locations.


	- Gave Jimmy Jenkins additional legendary chances. UCP made him function like a standard loot midget, and i added additional ones that scale with OP levels
	- Gave Loot Goon Goliaths additional legendary chances, scales with OP levels
	- Gave Muscles additional legendary chances, scales with OP levels


	- Increased Legendary weight from 3x to 5x in Terramorphous Peak and Winged Storm
		I didn't feel like it was giving enough yet. Even at 5x the normal legendary world drop rate, world drops will still be fairly uncommon


	- Increased Raid Bosses' additional legendary chance from a 2% base to 5% base. Still gets scaled by OP levels.

	- Replaced Voracidous's 10% chance to drop a Gen1 Legendary Class mod with a 25% chance for a Gen2 Legendary Class Mod
		Voracidous was given a new loot pool for Gen1 class mods which scales with OP levels (along with other raid bosses),
		so this is a way of making voracidous's drops a little more unique


	- Further reduced Raid Boss HP, some more than others


	- Adjusted Elemental Resistances to be a lot less harsh when using an unfavorable element against an enemy
		They are still noticable, but not 'remove 2/3 of your damage' noticable.
		i.e instead of 25% resistance that drops down to 50% in TVHM with fire, it's now 15/0%. In comparison to the highest elemental multiplier
		which would go from +50% damage against flesh to +75% damage in TVHM. So there is a gap of ~75%

	-Adjusted Shock damage multiplier in normal mode a little bit to give it a better damage curve that fits with all the other damage types


	- Made every round in each circle of slaughter repeatable once you've completed them at least once



	- Further nerfed elemental relics, as i felt they still gave too much power too easily.
		Max value at Level 80 went from 30% to 17% for fire/corrosive/shock. Slightly higher for explosive and slag.
		Bone of the Ancients was brought down accordingly as well.

		Do note that i think they will be just all-around good options in pretty much any situation anyway


	- Aggression Relics
		-Due to some changes i did internally, the gun damage/fire rate on aggression relics you already had gotten as drops will not work
		-Fixed rarer aggresion relic drops instead dropping the lower tier aggression relics

		- Lowered Values in a similar vein to elemental relics, though they are still higher


	- Improved chances for relics to be higher rarities in general

	- Reduced value of fire rate secondary stats on relics


	- Removed item level variation from items in vending machines


	- Added additional base status chance to slag elemental parts on guns



		== Unique item changes ==

	- Replaced the Lucrative Opportunity relic with the Loaded Dice
		gives you a somewhat small multiplicative buff to world drop legendary chances
		also applies to loot midgets and raid bosses' additional legendary drops


	- Law was reworked; now it is simply a 2-shot burst jakobs pistol.

	- Further reduced Gub damage and status chance

	- Lowered the speed of Impaler's spike projectiles
		This makes it home in on enemies easier, making it generally more consistent

	- Reduced Transformer shock damage to 10% and fire rate to 15%

	- Reduced Blockhead's damage

	- Reduced Death Toll relic's fire rate to match aggression relics

	- Reduced Sheriff's Badge relic's fire rate slightly



=============== [ 1.0.6 ] ===============

	- Doubled legendary world drop weight while in Digistruct Peak, the 3 Circles of Slaughter, Leviathan's Lair and Torgue's Arena (the big one in his DLC)

	- Changed Terramorphous's and Dragons of Destruction's doubled legendary world drop weight to instead be tripled.

	- Gave Hyperius, Master Gee and Voracidous a legendary pool for guns, shields, grenades and class mods individually that each have a 2% chance to drop.
		This scales with OP levels, with the chance doubling at OP5 and tripling at OP10.
		Pyro Pete already had this functionality

	- Added Cobra to the world drop sniper pool



	- Updated enemies to now also spawn with purple and legendary rarity items (by Temmmmy)

	- Fixed explosive snipers missing a muzzle flash (by ZetaDaemon)



	- Increased Deathtrap's base damage by 15%
	- Lowered Strength of 5 Gorillas' Deathtrap damage from 10% per point to 8%
		The final amount of damage you get will still be higher than before, but this also means that deathtrap
		is more powerful when you are playing the story as well.
		Reduces the effectiveness of Roid Shields a little bit

	- Increased Duty Calls critical damage from 4% per point to 5%
	- Changed Axton's Gunpowder skill tree passive buff from 4% magazine size to 4% gun damage.
		now also properly works for the Ranger skill

	- Added a part to Flicker's description on Maya that states that it only works with guns and grenades

	- Removed Restoration from Maya's skill tree
		Because co-op doesn't work.
		The skill has been removed from class mods as well.



	- Removed skill point variation on purple rarity class mods
		Makes it so purple rarity class mods are always 5/4/4 instead of having the chance for 5/4/3 and 5/3/4 as well (Level 50+ values ofc)

	- Added Onslaught back onto Axton's Legendary Ranger class mod

	- Replaced Mind's Eye on Nurse with Wreck
	- Replaced Suspension on Cleric with Sustenance

	- Tweaked the manufacturers of each character's class mods to try to better spread them out throughout all of them,
	  hopefully promoting more possible allegiance runs and in general switch things up a little bit
		This change does not apply to class mods you already had.

	- Added completely **new** class mods to fill the manufacturer spots where they did not have a non-unique class
	  mod after the previous change. This does not include every character yet, i will attempt to get those done in the future

		- Axton: Bandit(Outlaw)
		- Salvador: Dahl(Machine)



	- Made white rarity relics' stats always be the highest value they could be

	- Reduced Blood of the Seraphs' life steal from 10% to 5%



		== Unique item changes ==

	- Fixed Chere-amie incorrectly having explosive damage splash

	- Increased the damage of the Sloth

	- Massively reduced the damage of the Gub
	- Increased Gub ammo cost per shot from 2 to 3

	- Made Sham spawn with every part manufacturer except Maliwan.
		- Sham does not benefit from +Special boosts anymore, and Maliwan's only job
		  is to be the highest +Special boost, so it has no reason to spawn on the Sham
		- Also applies to Maliwan capacitors, so you are unable to get elemental immunities on it.


=============== [ 1.0.5 ] ===============

	- Heavily lowered voracidous's ludicrously high shield.
		This change only works in UVHM, but you aren't intended to fight raids outside of UVHM anyway.


	- Increased magazine size of Torgue Assault Rifles a little bit

	- Ported over from UCP a section in the Badass Rank screen that says that the mod is running (Tweaked to say the name of the mod of course)

	- Included a fix that makes Headhunter DLCs and Fight For Sanctuary properly scale in TVHM (by Temmmmmy)

	- Removed a UI element from Axton's Legendary Gunner that said that it increased cooldown rate
	- Increased the Sabre Turret's damage by ~20%

	- Doubled the status chance/damage stats on *non-unique* weapon parts. Also added them to parts that seemed to have lacked them.
		This should give even wider variation on the stats on the item cards, as well as give status effects even further power in general.

	- Fixed non-shock spike shields not actually doing any damage

	- Gave Chubbies/Tubbies a 20% chance to drop an additional legendary item (has a chance to be Pearlescent too. Same logic as loot midgets)

	- Reduced OOO spawn rate from 5%(UCP) to 3%. Twister drop is still guaranteed when you kill him.

	- Made Slag's status effect duration scale with effects that increase status effect duration (mainly krieg and gaige)


	== Unique item changes ==

	- Updated the unforgiven's stats and made it fall more in line with the stats of other slow firing jakobs pistols

	- Increased the damage of the Retcher
		Additionally, removed the possibility of it spawning with critical damage parts

	- Increased the damage of the Logan's Gun

	- Reduced the damage of the Emperor

	- Slightly increased fire rate and damage of the Fremington's Edge

=============== [ 1.0.4 ] ===============

	- Universally increased base reload speed of every weapon type by ~8-10%
		There isn't really any consistency to this, i just did what felt good. Some go above the 10%, but i tried to keep most around that area

	- Non-Unique Tediore shotguns (and Deliverance) now have a passive 35% increased pellet count
		-Damage per pellet was reduced to compensate. This overall increases the damage of the throw reload.
		-The other unique tediore shotguns were re-adjusted to make sure that they were still good

	- Adjusted E-Tech shotguns, with a complete rework of Tediore e-techs
		-Tediore E-Tech shotguns now guarantee a DoT on their throw, and said DoT is based on the card damage value rather than the DoT damage
		-Renamed to Corruptor

	- Removed mentions from Maya's and Zer0's skills that mention that the effects would apply to both you and teammates. Now it's just for you
		I didn't bother editing skills such as elated or res, as those were there to begin with. I mainly just removed the ones i put in myself.

	- Ported over a fix from UCP for the skyrocket to make it scale with OP levels

	- Ported over Legendary Class Mod skins from the UCP
		(Tweaked for the legendary class mods that were replaced in Oselands to have the appropriate skin)

	- Gave new skins to the Sawbar, Storm and Bearcat


=============== [ 1.0.3 ] ===============

	- Increased the cooldown rate gained from Nuke from 20% to 50%
	- Adjusted Burn Damage on Axton's Slayer of Terramorphous class mod
	- Fixed a bug with the Gunpowder passive bonus on the Ranger skill that bugged out your magazine.
		As a side effect, said passive bonus does not work on that skill anymore.

	- 1340 Shield now gives you 25% magazine size

	- Fixed a UI bug if you got a Fire Rate secondary stat on a Moxxi's Endowment

	- Gave Unforgiven a new skin


=============== [ 1.0.2 ] ===============

	- Improved fire rate and reload speed of tediore pistols
	- Improved fire rate of tediore SMGs

	- Removed DoT resistances from Hyperius's loaders


=============== [ 1.0.1 ] ===============

	- Fixed some UI on salvador class mods
	- Adjusted elemental damage modifiers and when the values get applied
	- Fixed backpack SDUs not giving you +4 mag


=============== [ 1.0 ] ===============

	- Mod Released. Amazing, i know.
