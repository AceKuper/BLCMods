# BL2:Wonderlands

A complete rework of Borderlands 2 characters' skill trees to add functionality to **multiclass** similar to Wonderlands.

In essence, there are 6 skill tree branches crafted specifically for this mod, each one representing a Borderlands 2 character. As if the unique aspects of that character were condensed into a single tree.

The character you are playing always comes with the tree dedicated to that character, and you can toggle your secondary class within the mod file using BLCMM.

Much like Wonderlands, the order of your skill trees does not matter (i.e Siren/Commando and Commando/Siren). Both versions has the exact same potential within their trees. The thing that differs is the action skill you are able to use

Your green skill tree is the one determined by the character you are playing, and blue is your selected secondary class.

The purpose of the red tree is for small stat bonuses after level 50 as you level up through UVHM, regardless of which classes you picked. The exact mechanics of it are explained in-game


### DISCLAIMER

If you are going to play with this mod and start at level 1, you need to make the character and get to the first fast travel point *before* you turn the mod on. If you enter the character select screen with Oselands turned on, your game will crash.

Also, the mod is incompatible with Co-Op. That also makes the game crash.




## How to install mod

*This section will assume that you haven't installed a BL2 mod before. Feel free to skip steps if you have it set up already*

**If you are completely new to modding**, please watch **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57WxvASCX70&t=1s)** done by Apple1417 to install the PythonSDK. This is required for both executing the mod in the game to apply its effects, and to make other mods work that Oselands requires to function.

*You may also click [this link](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) for a written guide on how to install the SDK. Also leads to the video guide listed above.*

**You then need to download the following PythonSDK mods if you have not already:**

> **[Command Extensions](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/)** - Required in creation of new objects such as weapon parts

> **[Sanity Saver](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/SanitySaver/)** - Required in saving new weapon parts onto your character

Oselands **will not work** if you have not properly installed and enabled these 2 mods (mainly command extensions, but still)

*Credits to Apple1417 for these mods*


**Once you have all this setup, please right click [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BLCM/BLCMods/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/osetor74/Oselands/Oselands.blcm) and save the mod file as Oselands.blcm**
