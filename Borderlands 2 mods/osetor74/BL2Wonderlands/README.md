# BL2:Wonderlands

A complete rework of Borderlands 2 characters' skill trees to add functionality to **multiclass** similar to Wonderlands.

In essence, there are 6 skill tree branches crafted specifically for this mod, each one representing a Borderlands 2 character. As if the unique aspects of that character were condensed into a single tree.

The character you are playing always comes with the tree dedicated to that character, and you can toggle your secondary class within the mod file using BLCMM.

Much like Wonderlands, the order of your skill trees does not matter (i.e Siren/Commando and Commando/Siren). Both versions has the exact same potential within their trees. The thing that differs is the action skill you are able to use
