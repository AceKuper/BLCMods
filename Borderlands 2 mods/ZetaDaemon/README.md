No Space Cowboy
============

Removes the need for the space cowboy mission to be active for the loot midget to spawn in the toilet.

Moneyshot Fix
============

The big major thing with this mod is that money shot is fixed! Yes thats right it's fixed, but you will need to install [Python SDK](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) and [Command Extentions](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/). Moneyshot now correctly checks for the mag size being less than 10 meaning it now also has the proper damage per level, as well as the damage for each hand is only checking the magazine size for the weapon in that hand, no more abusing jakobs shotguns in the offhand by having the grog in the mainhand.

Various Sal Fixes
============

Fixes up Monk, Raider, Titan and Legendary Titan COMs to now properly use the offhand bonuses, Amp Damage from Amp Shields now applies to both hands and the drunk effect from the grog now acts like a player skill and applies to both hands.
The rationale behind the grog change is that the character is the one that gets drunk not the gun itself, as you can hear and see the character being drunk, so now the bonuses will actually apply to both hands of salvador, but if you don't like the change it can be toggled off in BLCMM.
### Thanks to temmmmy for the info on the various things that needed fixing.
