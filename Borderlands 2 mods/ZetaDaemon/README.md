No Space Cowboy
===============

Removes the need for the space cowboy mission to be active for the loot midget to spawn in the toilet.

Moneyshot Fix
=============

This mod finally fixes Money Shot! Yes thats right it's fixed, but you will need to install [Python SDK](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) and [Command Extentions](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/). Moneyshot now correctly checks for the mag size being less than 10 meaning it now also has the proper damage per level, as well as the damage for each hand is only checking the magazine size for the weapon in that hand, no more abusing jakobs shotguns in the offhand by having the grog in the mainhand.
Changelog
=========
V1.1 - Updated to be properly multiplicative to other gun damage bonuses like moneyshot is in vanilla

Various Sal Fixes
=================

Fixes up Monk, Raider, Renegade, Titan, Legendary Titan and Legendary Berserker COMs to now properly use the offhand bonuses and check the correct hand for weapon type specific bonuses, Amp Damage from Amp Shields now applies to both hands and the drunk effect from the grog now acts like a player skill and applies to both hands.

Also includes an option for the base game class mod fixes to include the UCP edits to the COMs, so if you plan to use this mod with UCP with the COM changes it makes, make sure to select the UCP category under 'Base Game COMs'.

The rationale behind the grog change is that the character is the one that gets drunk not the gun itself, as you can hear and see the character being drunk, so now the bonuses will actually apply to both hands of salvador, but if you don't like the change it can be toggled off in BLCMM.
### Thanks to temmmmy for the info on the various things that needed fixing.
