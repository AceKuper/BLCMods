No Space Cowboy
============

Removes the need for the space cowboy mission to be active for the loot midget to spawn in the toilet.

Moneyshot and Tina COM Fix
============

The big major thing with this mod is that money shot is fixed! Yes thats right it's fixed, but you will need to install [Python SDK](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) and [Command Extentions](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/). Moneyshot now correctly checks for the mag size being less than 10 meaning it now also has the proper damage per level, as well as the damage for each hand is only checking the magazine size for the weapon in that hand, no more abusing jakobs shotguns in the offhand by having the grog in the mainhand
Secondly the tiny tina DLC COMs are now fixed so that the passive bonuses will also properly apply to salvadors left hand, this part of the mod can be used without python sdk and command extentions but you will need to then toggle off the money shot fix category in BLCMM if you don't want to install Python SDK and Command Extentions
