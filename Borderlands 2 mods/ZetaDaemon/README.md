-No Space Cowboy

Removes the need for the space cowboy mission to be active for the loot midget to spawn in the toilet.

-Salvador Fixes

The big major thing with this mod is that money shot is fixed! Yes thats right it's fixed, but you will need to install [Python Sdk](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) and [Command Extentions](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/), one thing to note with the moneyshot fix is that it wont play the sound or do the muzzle flash on the last shot as currently I haven't been able to get that working. Moneyshot now correctly checks for the mag size being less than 10 meaning it now also has the proper damage per level, as well as the damage for each hand is only checking the magazine size for the weapon in that hand, no more abusing jakobs shotguns in the offhand by having the grog in the mainhand
Secondly the tiny tina DLC COMs are now fixed so that the passive bonuses will also properly apply to salvadors left hand.
