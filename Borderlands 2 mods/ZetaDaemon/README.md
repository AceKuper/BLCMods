-No Space Cowboy

Removes the need for the space cowboy mission to be active for the loot midget to spawn in the toilet.

-Salvador Fixes

The big major thing with this mod is that money shot is fixed! Yes thats right it's fixed, but you will need to install [Python Sdk](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) and [Command Extentions](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/), one thing to note with the moneyshot fix is that it wont play the sound or do the muzzle flash on the last shot as currently I haven't been able to get that working. Secondly the tiny tina DLC COMs are now fixed so that the passive bonuses will also properly apply to salvadors left hand.
