BL2 Fast Travel TimeSaver XL
============================

**NOTE:** This mod is considered deprecated now, because all of its
functionality has been folded into my "BL2 Mega TimeSaver XL" mod
instead.  You'll probably be happier using that mod instead!

This simple little mod speeds up the animations of Fast Travel stations
becoming active.  This is mostly just useful for the handful of stations
which initially start closed, when the level loads -- if you start your game
right outside one of these stations and want to warp away, you've got to
wait for the animation to complete before doing so.

Specifically, the three locations I'm aware of:

 * Three Horns Valley
 * Highlands (Overlook)
 * Hunter's Grotto (Lodge)

Usage/Installation
==================

This mod must be imported into BLCMM using `File -> Import single mod`.
Choose the file `BL2 Fast Travel TimeSaver XL.blcm` and have at it!
