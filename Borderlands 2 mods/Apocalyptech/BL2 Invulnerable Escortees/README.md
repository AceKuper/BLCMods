BL2 Invulnerable Escortees
==========================

There are a few missions in BL2 in which you must keep either an enemy or
an ally alive, or else fail the mission.  This mod makes those escortees
invulnerable (or at least effectively invulnerable), so you no longer
have to worry about inadvertantly failing the mission.  This is most
useful for the escort missions where your charge is hostile, because the
player can no longer accidentally kill them while taking care of the
other enemies in the area.

The full list of affected escortees is:

 * **Enrique**: Tina's pet in the Torgue DLC, during the mission
   "Walking the Dog"
 * **Flesh-Stick**: Tina's nemesis during the "You Are Cordially
   Invited" quest line in Tundra Express
 * **Hacked Overseer**: The hacked constructor from the mission
   "Statuesque" in Opportunity
 * **Mosstache**: Aubrey's instrument of vengeance in the Dragon
   Keep DLC mission "Tree Hugger"
 * **Mr. Sparks**, the generator in *You Are Cordially Invited: Tea Party*.
   It's pretty rare that the generator ever gets in real danger,
   but technically it would fail the quest if it were to die.
 * **Ol' Pukey**, from the Hammerlock DLC mission *Ol' Pukey*.
 * **Supply Crate**, in Thousand Cuts during *Defend Slab Tower*.
   I don't know that I've ever even seen this take damage during
   normal gameplay, but here it is regardless.

One enemy only receives a 25x health buff (bringing it a bit past
"badass" level) rather than the usual buffs:

 * **Der Monstrositat**: The Borok Dietmar wants you to trap in the
   Hammerlock DLC mission "Still Just a Borok in a Cage."  UCP makes
   Der Monstrositat respawnable, and an alternate source for the
   Chopper, so full invulnerability seems unwarranted if you're
   using UCP.  The default is a 25x health boost (Badass Boroks
   are 16x).  You can optionally choose to make Der Monstrositat
   effectively invulnerable anyway, if you want.

Additionally, one more is disabled by default:

 * **Murderlin's Son**: The tower you must defend in the Dragon
   Keep DLC quest "The Magic of Childhood."  Making the tower
   invulnerable makes this quest pretty pointless: you can win
   by just sitting there doing literally nothing.  So, it's
   disabled by default, though you can choose to make the tower
   invulnerable anyway if you like.

Note that Maya's "Converge" skill has a fairly unique damage type
definition -- most likely a subtle bug in the game code, honestly --
and the damage from Converge cannot by default be blocked by any
enemy.  The increased health pools given to these escortees should
protect them from casual Converging, though.

There are a few instances where you're tasked with defending
something but the mission doesn't fail when it receives too much
damage; I opted not to make any changes to those missions.
Specifically, the lunar supply beacon in *Bright Lights, Flying
City*, and the flag generators in *Capture the Flags*.

Mod Construction / Implementation Details

*(This section is only relevant for someone looking to edit the mod in the
same way I do, or just someone curious about my mod construction techniques.
If you're just looking to run the mod, see the "Usage" section above.  The
mod can, of course, be edited directly in BLCMM as well, once it's
been imported.)*

This mod is generated using a Python script named `generate-mod.py`.  The
script makes use of `modprocessor.py` from the parent directory.  You'll need
to copy (or symlink, if you're on Mac or Linux) `modprocessor.py` into this
directory in order to run the script.
