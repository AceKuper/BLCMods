Apocalyptech's Borderlands 2 Mods
=================================

This is a collection of the mods that I've put together for BL2.  I've got
an area in the `Pre Sequel Mods` directory as well, so feel free to check
that out (though damned if I can get this README to link to it).

The mods found in the main BLCMods repo are intended to be the full, most
recently-released version.  I do most of my work on mods
[in my own BLCMods Fork](https://github.com/apocalyptech/BLCMods/), so you
can head over there to see if I have anything in the works, if you want.
Note that my larger mods (Better Loot and Cold Dead Hands) have their own
branches, so you can browse in `bl2betterloot`, `bl2colddeadhands`,
`tpsbetterloot`, or `tpscolddeadhands`, in addition to `master`, if you like.

Mod List
========

### Aegrus Not-So-Rare Monsters

This is a real simple mod which just alters the spawn rates of the "rare"
creature types in Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt.  This is really only
useful if you're looking to complete the
[I Like My Monsters Rare](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/I_Like_My_Monsters_Rare)
mission without having to do any extra farming.

### Always Active Friendship Gulag Searchlights

Makes the searchlights in Friendship Gulag be always active, regardless of time
of day.  This makes the "In the Middle of the Night" challenge (now renamed
"In the Middle of Whenever") achievable during the day.

This will, of course, give you some extra things to shoot at while spending
some time in the Friendship Gulag.

### Always Visible Urine

Makes the skag urine during the Hammerlock DLC quest "Urine, You're Out"
always visible and clickable, regardless of whether it's night or day.
(So long as the quest is active, anyway.)  No more wondering if you've
missed the nighttime or not!

### BL2 Better Loot Mod

This mod's general goal is to make loot drops in Borderlands 2 "better",
as in skewing very much towards the rarer loot.
Legendaries/Uniques/Pearls/Seraphs will drop far more frequently than they
do in vanilla B2, etc.

It's essentially a cheat mod, intended for those BL2 players like myself who
tend to play in Normal most of the time, dislike grinding, get bored easily by
the uninteresting and drab loot that typically gets dropped in-game, and who
often end up just resorting to Gibbed to be able to play around with some
better gear.  The README in the mod dir itself should provide a lot more info.

### BL2 Cold Dead Hands

This mod completely revamps the way in which weapons and shields are
acquired during the game.  Instead of dropping weapons/shields from a
random loot pool, enemies will now *always* drop the specific gun and
shield that they're using.  In the default configuration, enemy gear
quality is also improved considerably.

### BL2 Configurable Slot Machines

This mod allows you to configure just about every facet of the base game's
slot machines, of the sort found in Sanctuary (and, I believe, on One-Armed
Bandits).  The default configuration leaves the slot machines exactly how
they are in the base game -- you **must** configure the options you want.

### BL2 Early Bloomer

Unlocks all weapons/items to be able to spawn right at the beginning of the game.
A more powerful version of the same functionality provided by UCP.  (This is
technically a subset of Better Loot; if you're already running Better Loot then
you already have this.)

### BL2 Expanded Legendary Pools

This mod adds all legendary items across DLCs into the global legendary loot
pools, and by default adds all uniques, seraphs, and pearlescents into the
legendary pools, too.  The mod will also by default add in gemstone weapons
into the E-Tech pool, and add the Dragon Keep "Alignment" Class Mods to the
global class mod drops.

### BL2 Faster Rockets and Gyrojets

This mod improves the speed of all gyrojet-based projectiles by 3x,
which also affects other Torgue-barrel-provided projectiles on ARs,
like grenades on Jakobs and Dahl ARs.  Rocket speeds are also buffed
by 3x, since I nearly always take Vladof launchers over other brands.
Vladof launchers do get a buff, but only get a much-smaller 1.4x.

### BL2 Happy Horizontal People Transporter

A replacement for the Mongol which can be used to transport your enemies
(or yourself) across Pandora in style.  Order yours today!

### BL2 Invulnerable Escortees

There are a few missions in BL2 in which you must keep either an enemy or
an ally alive, or else fail the mission.  This mod makes those escortees
invulnerable (or at least effectively invulnerable), so you no longer
have to worry about inadvertantly failing the mission.  This is most
useful for the escort missions where your charge is hostile, because the
player can no longer accidentally kill them while taking care of the
other enemies in the area.

### BL2 Mega TimeSaver XL

This mod speeds up nearly all the noticeably-slow interactive objects
that you use throughout BL2 by 5x (in general), most notably:

 * Containers
 * Doors / Gates
 * Drawbridges
 * Fast Travel Stations *(primarily for Three Horns Valley, Highlands, and Hunter's Grotto)*
 * Lifts / Elevators / Transporters
 * Slot Machines
 * Vehicle Aimations

### BL2 Movement Speed Cheats

This mod increases movement speed of all BL2 characters (including while
crouched, and while in FFYL).  It also increases the jump height a bit, and
increases air control by quite a lot.  If you're looking to zip through
some levels like there's no tomorrow, this is for you.

### BL2 No Wasted COMs

This mod changes the Class Mod drop pools such that the only COMs which drop
are for characters who are actually playing the game.  For a singleplayer
game, that means you'll only ever get COMs for your one character, for
instance.

### Fragile Minecraft Blocks

Causes the Minecraft blocks (in the little secret area of Caustic Caverns) to
be extremely fragile.  Damage of any sort will destroy them immediately now:
a single melee strike will do, but also guns, grenades, and anything else.

### Guaranteed Omnd-Omnd-Ohk

Gives all Badass Savages a 100% chance of evolving into Omnd-Omnd-Ohk, when
left in the presence of a Witch Doctor.  Mostly just useful if you want to
farm OOO without having to gamble on its spawn chances.

### Guaranteed Varkid Evolution

Gives all Varkids a 100% chance of evolution, regardless of player count or
playthrough.  Mostly just useful if you want to farm Vermivorous without
having to gamble on its spawn chances.

### More Muscles

This simple mod improves the spawn rate for Muscles, a unique Bruiser who
appears in Thousand Cuts.  He will be fairly likely to appear during a full
playthrough of the level.

### No Crushers in Lair of Infinite Agony

There is a little puzzle in Lair of Infinite Agony where the player
must traverse a short hallway with four sections of the floor which
cycle up and down, threatening to crush the player.  It's not a
difficult puzzle, but waiting around and instadeath aren't what I
play Borderlands for.  This mod disables them!

### Sorted Fast Travel

Sorts the fast travel menu by default, and removes "the" prefix from level
names, so everything sorts properly.

### Speedier Sandskiffs

Improves the speed (and afterburner capability) of Sandskiffs.

### Stalkers Use Shields

Stalkers already use shields, of course, but this mod equips them with "real"
shields, of the sort your characters equip.  Optionally, you can have them
only use Maylay shields, as well.

### Trailer Trashing Counts as Night

The mission "Clan War: Trailer Trashing" has an optional objective to arrive at
the Hodunk Speedway at night.  Waiting is boring, so this mod makes it so the
optional objective always completes regardless of time of day.

### Unlocked MMORPGFPS

Removes the kill requirements from the Dragon Keep mission "MMORPGFPS."

### Unlocked My Kingdom for a Wand

Removes the kill restrictions for your targets during the Dragon Keep DLC
mission "My Kingdom for a Wand."  No more repeadedly trying to get that
crit kill on the Orc and having Cloud Kill finish him off instead!

### Wildlife Preservation Fewer Injured Loaders

The story mission "Wildlife Preservation" requires you to injure at least
three loaders without killing them, which can be difficult sometimes,
especially in conjunction with skills like Maya's Cloud Kill.  This mod
reduces the required-injured count to 1.  The doors should open once you've
gotten a single loader to be in the "injured" status.

Obsolete Mods
=============

### Configurable Catch-A-Ride

*Note:* This mod has been obsoleted by [Our Lord and Savior Gabe Newell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/OurLordAndSaviorGabeNewell)'s
[More Vehicles](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/OurLordAndSaviorGabeNewell/MoreVehicles.blcm) mod.

This mod is a souped-up version of FromDarkHell's "CarReplacements" mod,
which changed some of the Catch-A-Ride locations so that you can spawn
various types of vehicles throughout all the game's content.  That version
just had a few hardcoded replacements, though.  This one lets you fully
customize every single Catch-A-Ride slot in the game!

### More Loot Midget Containers

*Note:* This mod has been obsoleted by [mopioid](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/mopioid)'s
[Loot Midget World](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/mopioid/LootMidgetWorld.blcm) mod.

Alters a few levels (specifically: Arid Nexus Badlands, Hero's Pass, Opportunity,
Sawtooth Cauldron, and Tundra Express) so that as many containers as possible
can spawn loot midgets.  This doesn't meant that *all* containers can spawn
midgets, but there'll be more than there were.

Utilities
=========

I like writing my mods using code, so that I can set constants which are used
throughout the mod file, or just simply take advantage of looping and keeping
data in useful data structures, etc.  BLCMM includes a Plugins architecture
which will eventually be public, which could provide that kind of thing right
from BLCMM, but for now I use Python to construct nearly all of my mods.

The utilities in here are what assists me in doing so.  These utilities are
written in Python, and probably require Python 3.  They're intended to just be
run from a commandline, which may pose some logistical problems for folks on
Windows/Mac who may not be used to doing that.  (Also, Python probably isn't
already installed by default on those platforms.) Folks running Linux, like
myself, should be able to just run 'em as per usual from a terminal.

modprocessor.py
---------------

This is my latest mod-construction library, which lets me build mods
programmatically the way I'm used to while exporting in a BLCMM-compatible
file format.  It uses a custom intermediate file format which is very
similar to FilterTool's format, which then gets converted to BLCMM.  That way I
can easily continue to use code-assisted templates for mod construction, which
is the way I still prefer to do things.  This is mostly intended to be used
by my generation code itself, but it can be invoked on the commandline to
convert my custom mod-building format into a BLCM-style mod file as well.

conv_to_human.py
----------------

This utility takes FT or BLCMM files and converts them to something extremely
close to the custom format which `modprocessor.py` uses, and converts any
single-line statements into multiline, if appropriate.  The file generated
may not be 100% compatible with `modprocessor.py` -- I only really use this
tool for manual verification and comparison, so it's not worth it to make it
100%.  This can also be used on `obj dump` output to make that nicer as well.

For instance, if you've got a file which contains the following:

    BalancedItems(0)=(ItmPoolDefinition=None,InvBalanceDefinition=InventoryBalanceDefinition'GD_Artifacts.A_Item.A_Vitality_Rare',Probability=(BaseValueConstant=1.000000,BaseValueAttribute=None,InitializationDefinition=None,BaseValueScaleConstant=1.000000),bDropOnDeath=True)

... this utility would convert it to something like:

    BalancedItems(
        0
    )=(
        ItmPoolDefinition=None,
        InvBalanceDefinition=InventoryBalanceDefinition'GD_Artifacts.A_Item.A_Vitality_Rare',
        Probability=(
            BaseValueConstant=1.000000,
            BaseValueAttribute=None,
            InitializationDefinition=None,
            BaseValueScaleConstant=1.000000
        ),
        bDropOnDeath=True
    )

If you don't specify any filenames, this util will read/write to STDIN/STDOUT.
You an also use `-` as either of the filenames, if you wanted to use
STDIN/STDOUT for one end but not the other.

The utility will ask you to overwrite the output file, if it's specified and
already exists.  You can use the `-f` or `--force` option to automatically
overwrite without confirmation.  You can also use `-h` or `--help` as you'd
hope, though there's no features not already mentioned here.
