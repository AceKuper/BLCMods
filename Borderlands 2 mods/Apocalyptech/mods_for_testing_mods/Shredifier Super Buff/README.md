Shredifier Super Buff
=====================

An absurdly-OP Shredifier, intended to be used while testing out mods so
you don't have to spare a thought about actual combat.

Not recommended for testing mods which impact combat, naturally.  Also not
intended for regular gameplay; you'll oneshot nearly everything until you
start hitting OP levels, and even then your enemies will go down with very
minimal effort.  Bullet reflection is your biggest enemy with this;
Aaron0000's "No More Enemy Bullet Reflection" mod is recommended.  Use my
Neogenator Super Buff mod to further insulate yourself from potential
reflections.

Features:

 * Extraordinary damage
 * Infinite ammo
 * Fast bullets
 * Quick weapon swap times
 * 100% Elemental Effect Chance, not that you'll need it
 * Crazy fire rate
 * Zero spin-up time
 * Effectively perfect accuracy (note that the default "kick" which all
   weapons have remains in effect, since changing it would affect all
   Vladof ARs, not just this mod)
