Neogenator Super Buff
=====================

An absurdly-OP Neogenator, intended to be used while testing out mods so
you don't have to spare a thought about actual combat.

Not recommended for testing mods which impact combat, naturally.  Also
not intended for regular gameplay; you'll be basically invulnerable even
on OP10.

Features:

 * Huge capacity
 * Instant regeneration
 * Near instant health regeneration - even if something breaks through,
   you'll be back up above the health gate basically immediately

Usage/Installation
==================

This mod must be imported into BLCMM using `File -> Import single mod`.
Choose the file `Neogenator Super Buff.blcm` and have at it!
