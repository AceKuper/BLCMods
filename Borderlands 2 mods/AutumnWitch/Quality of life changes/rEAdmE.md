 Hello again! Autumn here to tell you about these Quality of life changes I found while digging in some Charactor data
 
 
  # Normal Versions

    These commands must be exec in game, out of menu, or they simply will not work
    Its actually very finiky to get working with normal set commands, as the changes arent always loaded
    For less of a headache, use the hotfix versions
 
  # Hotfix Versions

    The easist way to merge hotfixes is to use LightChaosman's Filter Tool
    I also have a video on my youtube channel that shows you how to manually combine hotfixes
    
 # Cleaner Shock and AUGH

    So that all those reloads dont blind you.
    
 # God Mode

    Never take damage, for any reason. You are a God now, this is your kingdom.

   # Hide Undescovered Missions

    Dont you hate that your mission list is a mile long with those greyed out "Mission Not yet Found" tags?
    Well this gets rid of those from your menu.

  # Less Death Cost

    Lowers the cost of being revived after death to 1% of current money from 7%.
    

  # Throw Grendades in FFYL

    Umm, whats to explain here?
    You throw grenades... while down...
