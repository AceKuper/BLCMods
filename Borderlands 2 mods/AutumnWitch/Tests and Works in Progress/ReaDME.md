Hia! Autumn here to tell you about my Projects and Proofs of Concepts.

   # LaLonde
   
      The goal with this weapon was to understand how a gun that scales with your level would function.
      My friend also wanted something OP to get themselves through UVHM easier
      And I made it pretty
      
   # Gemstone Glitches
   
      The goal here was to port Glitch weapons from TPS to BL2
      So far Ive hammered out the buffs the Glitches give,
      but I still need to find a way to have them all apply with the Evil Smasher Behavior
      
   # Maggie Madness

     This was an experiment to see how different parts of weapons behave when you modify the numbers
     Turns out it also makes the maggie really strong!
     
   # Vladon

     Do you get tired of seeing non-Vladoff weapons?
     Do you like puns?
     Well this is the mod for you!
     Makes all weapon parts appear as their Vladoff counterparts
