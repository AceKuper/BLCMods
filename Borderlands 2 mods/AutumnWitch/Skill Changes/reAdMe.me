 Hello again! Autumn here to tell you about the skill changes I've made.
 
 
 # SmallerLighterFaster

    Increased the Reload bonus from 6% to 10%.
    Lowers the Shock and Augh reload bonus from 25% to 10%.
    Logic: Axtons Ready is 8% per point at T1 with no downside, this makes it competitive with that.
    Logic: 25% on a Game Changer was a bit much, so I spread out the bonuses some more.
   
 # Anarchy Rework

    Halved stacks, doubled bonuses and downsides.
    Lowers Rational anarchist to 15 stacks instead of 25 to compensate.
    Max unboosted stacks lowered to 200 from 400.
    With claws bonuses where also doubled per stack.
    
 # Cooking Up Trouble Change

    Now regen health as long as your mag is half full.
    Lowered health regen from .4% to .3% per point.

 # Death From Above Buff
 
    Significantly improved the damage.
    Increased the radius from 500 to 750.
    Added a Stagger effect.
    Changed the damage type from Explosive to Shock.
    Increased the Cooldown from 2s to 5s to prevent accidental loss of stacks.
    
 # Electrical Burn Buff
   
    Increased chance per point from 4% to 6%.
 
 # Interspersed Outburst Buff

    Upped the slag chance by 2x.
    Slags often at 5/5.
 
 # Myelin Buff

    Increased shock resistance.
    Logic: With More Pep buffed in the UCP Myelin didnt have a place.
    
 # Potent as a Pony Change

    Swaped Gaige and DTs health stat bonuses.
    Logic: Gaige doesnt need the hp boost as much because of her many shield synergies, but DT benifits heavily with the added heath.
    
 # Shock Storm Change
    
    Changed Shock Storm from procing on Crit kill to procing on shock damage kill.
    This allows Shock Storm to "chain" due to the skill itself doing shock damage.
    DT can also prock Shock Storm when he kills.
    
 # Slag Make It Sparkle

    Made all varrients of Make It Sparkle give DT additional Slag damage.
    This was done so that one doesnt have to swap back to slag DT mid fight.
    However, DT will still look like whichever element he was last shot with.
    For style of course.
   
 # SmallerLighterFaster

    Increased the Reload bonus from 6% to 10%.
    Lowers the Shock and Augh reload bonus from 25% to 10%.
    Logic: Axtons Ready is 8% per point at T1 with no downside, this makes it competitive with that.
