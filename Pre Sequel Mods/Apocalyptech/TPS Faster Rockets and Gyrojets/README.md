TPS Faster Rockets and Gyrojets
===============================

After years of playing TPS, I've found that I basically never use
most Torgue weapons, outside of various named legendaries/uniques and
the occasional specific part combos, because the gyrojet speed was
just too much of a detriment for me.  So, I figured rather than
continue to never use these weapons, I should just speed 'em up and
have a wider pool of weapons available to me!

This mod improves the speed of all gyrojet-based projectiles by 3x,
which also affects other Torgue-barrel-provided projectiles on ARs,
like grenades on Jakobs and Dahl ARs.  Rocket speeds are also buffed
by 3x, since I nearly always take Vladof launchers over other brands.
Vladof launchers do get a buff, but only get a much-smaller 1.4x.

Many Unique/Legendary Torgues also get a buff, though those are
generally more slight.  A few other non-Torgue weapons snuck in here
as well, such as the Too Scoops.  Here's the list of specific named
gear that's been given a bit of a boost:

* 88 Fragnum
* Badaboom
* Berrigan
* Cryophobia
* Jack-o'-Cannon
* KerBoom
* Mongol
* Moonface
* Moonscaper
* Nukem
* Thingy
* Too Scoops
* Torguemada
* Volt Thrower
* Wombat

I am of course well aware that speeding up these projectiles is
getting rid of one of the main balances meant to counteract the
generally-increased damage output these weapons are capable of,
but I have never been one to shy away from OP gear.
