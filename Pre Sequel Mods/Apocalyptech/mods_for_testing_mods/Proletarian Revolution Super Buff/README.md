Proletarian Revolution Super Buff
=================================

An absurdly-OP Proletarian Revolution, intended to be used while testing
out mods so you don't have to spare a thought about actual combat.

Not recommended for testing mods which impact combat, naturally.  Also not
intended for regular gameplay; you'll oneshot nearly everything.  Bullet
reflection is your biggest enemy with this, though I don't think that's
super prevalent in TPS.  Use my Reogenator Super Buff mod to help insulate
yourself from potential reflections.

Features:

 * Extraordinary damage
 * Infinite ammo
 * Fast bullets
 * Quick weapon swap times
 * 100% Elemental Effect Chance, not that you'll need it
 * Crazy fire rate
 * Zero spin-up time
 * Effectively perfect accuracy (note that the default "kick" which all
   weapons have remains in effect, since changing it would affect all
   Vladof ARs, not just this mod)

Usage/Installation
==================

This mod must be imported into BLCMM using `File -> Import single mod`.
Choose the file `Proletarian Revolution Super Buff.blcm` and have at it!
