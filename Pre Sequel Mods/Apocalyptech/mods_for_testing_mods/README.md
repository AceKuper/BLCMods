Apocalyptech's Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel Mods For Testing Mods
================================================================

This is a small collection of mods that I've done whose primary purpose
is just to assist in testing out other mods.  Most of the mods I work on
are loot-focused, or otherwise unconcerned with actual moment-to-moment
gameplay, so I like to be able to not worry about combat, or actually
having to *search* for drops or the like, so I'll use these to just help
out my testing process.

Other mods that I tend to find invaluable for testing are more general-purpose,
such as my Movement Speed Cheats, and Mega TimeSaver XL.

Mod List
========

### Proletarian Revolution Super Buff


An absurdly-OP Proletarian Revolution, intended to be used while testing
out mods so you don't have to spare a thought about actual combat.

### Reogenator Super Buff

An absurdly-OP Reogenator, intended to be used while testing out mods so
you don't have to spare a thought about actual combat.

### Testing Loot Drops

This isn't really a mod, per se, so much as a little thing I use while
testing drops, to get a feel for how a pool's item/weapon distribution
feels, or for ensuring that a pool contains all the items that I expect
it to.  The mod itself is not actually stored in git.  To use, you'll have
to be Python-conversant enough to alter `generate-mod.py` to suit, and
run it to generate the mod you want, then import into BLCMM.
