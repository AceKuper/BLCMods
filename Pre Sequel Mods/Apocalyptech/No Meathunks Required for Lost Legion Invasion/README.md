No Meathunks Required for Lost Legion Invasion
==============================================

Early in the game, during the Lost Legion Invasion mission, you are required
to melee four locks to open a door, to get to an Oz Kit.  I've always found
the top two to be annoying to jump to, especially when using my movement
speed cheats, so I've made it so they can be damaged by any damage source.
No meathunks required!
