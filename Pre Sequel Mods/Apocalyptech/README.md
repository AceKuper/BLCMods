Apocalyptech's Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel Mods
===============================================

This is a collection of the mods that I've put together for TPS.  I've got
an area in the `Borderlands 2 mods` directory as well, so feel free to check
that out (though damned if I can get this README to link to it).

The mods found in the main BLCMods repo are intended to be the full, most
recently-released version.  I do most of my work on mods
[in my own BLCMods Fork](https://github.com/apocalyptech/BLCMods/), so you
can head over there to see if I have anything in the works, if you want.
Note that my larger mods (Better Loot and Cold Dead Hands) have their own
branches, so you can browse in `bl2betterloot`, `bl2colddeadhands`,
`tpsbetterloot`, or `tpscolddeadhands`, in addition to `master`, if you like.

testing other mods, but which aren't suitable for everyday use.

Mod List
========

### AdBlocker 2000

Tired of running headlong into those damned pop-up ads in Nexus and
Motherlessboard?  Rage no longer!  A quick install of our fresh new
*AdBlocker 2000* will clear those right up.  Never be bothered by those
pesky ads again!

### Easier ECLIPSE and EOS

This mod makes the ECLIPSE and EOS boss fights at the end of the Claptastic
Voyage DLC easier in a variety of ways.  The default settings in the mod
aim to have the bosses remain quite dangerous -- the goal isn't really to
make them *super* easy (except on the "Total Chump" option).

### Guaranteed M0RQ, Cutie Killer, and Heartfull Splodger

*(Included in TPS UCP 2.2 in the base patch - no need to use this one
separately if you're already using TPS UCP 2.2!)*

There are three chests hidden around in the Claptastic Voyage DLC which
provide, respectively, the M0RQ shield, and the unique glitch weapons
Cutie Killer and Heartfull Splodger.  These chests are intended to only
be available once per playthrough, but some bug in Borderlands can
sometimes cause the chests to spawn already open, which prevents the
player from receiving the loot during the current playthrough.  This
mod simply makes it so that those chests will always spawn in an
openable state, so the player can always get that loot.

### Guaranteed Phonic

*(Included as an optional selection in TPS UCP 2.2 - no need to use this
one separately if you're already using TPS UCP 2.2!)*

Guarantees the spawn of Phonic Kraggon (or Phuper Phonic Kraggon) in Serenity's
Waste.

### Infinite Air Boosts

Removes the restriction of one-air-boost-per-jump, so you can just keep on
boosting forever!  Well, that's not *totally* true -- you still need to have
Oxygen in order to boost.  Still, if you're in an atmosphere, you can
pretty much just keep going until your keyboard gives out.

### Luneshine on Uniques

Adds Luneshine attachments to several Unique/Legendary weapons which didn't
previously have them.  **WARNING:** This will generate weapons which TPS will
delete from your inventory, if it's started up without this mod enabled.

### No Broken Chests Near Denial Subroutine

*(Included in TPS UCP 2.2 in the base patch - no need to use this one
separately if you're already using TPS UCP 2.2!)*

The Denial Subroutine arena (in Cluster 99002 0V3RL00K) has six bandit
"coolers" which don't actually work -- they open and spawn their items, but the
items can't actually be picked up.  This mod changes them to be the round ammo
chests instead, so at least they work.

### No Meathunks Required for Lost Legion Invasion

Early in the game, during the Lost Legion Invasion mission, you are required
to melee four locks to open a door, to get to an Oz Kit.  I've always found
the top two to be annoying to jump to, especially when using my movement
speed cheats, so I've made it so they can be damaged by any damage source.
No meathunks required!

### No SpyBugs in The Cortex

*(Included as an optional selection in TPS UCP 2.2 - no need to use this
one separately if you're already using TPS UCP 2.2!)*

SpyBugs are ordinarily minor annoyances at worst.  When they spawn during a
Mutator arena match in The Cortex, though, they can become quite annoying,
since the arena won't continue until all enemies have been destroyed, and
the SpyBugs can be quite reluctant to decloak sometimes.  Which leaves the
vault hunters shooting desperately in the air, guided only by the minimap
and some sound effects.

This mod disables SpyBugs in The Cortex, so they won't spawn at all in
there.  That's it!

### Speedier Moon Buggies

This mod improves the speed of both varieties of Moon Buggies in Borderlands: The
Pre-Sequel, mostly with an eye to ensuring that the few early-game jumps are 
a bit easier to hit when using the buggy.   The jump back from Concordia to the
main Serenity's Waste area, for instance, is usually easily missed if you don't
happen to aim for the right part of the bridge.  With this mod, I've been able
to get that one at 100% regardless of which part of the bridge I'm aiming at.

### Speedier Stingrays

This mod improves the speed of both varieties of Stingrays in Borderlands: The
Pre-Sequel.  Stingrays were already quite good, but this makes traversing the
icy wastes even speedier.  In addition to a general speed improvement, this
increases the afterburner charge and improves handling quite a bit.

### TPS Better Loot Mod

This mod's general goal is to make loot drops in The Pre-Sequel "better",
as in skewing very much towards the rarer loot.  Legendaries/Uniques will
drop far more frequently than they do in vanilla TPS, glitch/luneshine
weapons will spawn in the main world, etc.

It's essentially a cheat mod, intended for those TPS players like myself who
tend to play in Normal most of the time, dislike grinding, get bored easily by
the uninteresting and drab loot that typically gets dropped in-game, and who
often end up just resorting to Gibbed to be able to play around with some
better gear.  The README in the mod dir itself should provide a lot more info.

### TPS Cold Dead Hands

This mod completely revamps the way in which weapons and shields are
acquired during the game.  Instead of dropping weapons/shields from a
random loot pool, enemies will now *always* drop the specific gun and
shield that they're using.  In the default configuration, enemy gear
quality is also improved considerably.

### TPS Configurable Slot Machines

This mod allows you to configure just about every facet of the base game's
slot machines, of the sort found in Concordia.  The default configuration
leaves the slot machines exactly how they are in the base game -- you **must**
configure the options you want.

### TPS Early Bloomer

Unlocks all weapons/items to be able to spawn right at the beginning of the game.
A more powerful version of the same functionality provided by UCP.  (This is
technically a subset of Better Loot; if you're already running Better Loot then
you already have this.)

### TPS Expanded Legendary Pools

This mod adds all legendary items across DLCs into the global legendary loot
pools, and by default adds all uniques and glitch uniques into the
legendary pools, too.

### TPS Faster Rockets and Gyrojets

This mod improves the speed of all gyrojet-based projectiles by 3x,
which also affects other Torgue-barrel-provided projectiles on ARs,
like grenades on Jakobs and Dahl ARs.  Rocket speeds are also buffed
by 3x, since I nearly always take Vladof launchers over other brands.
Vladof launchers do get a buff, but only get a much-smaller 1.4x.

### TPS Happy Horizontal People Transporter

A replacement for the Mongol which can be used to transport your enemies
(or yourself) across Elpis in style.  Order yours today!

### TPS Invulnerable Escortees

There are a few missions in TPS (nearly all in Lunar Launching Station,
weirdly) in which you must keep either an enemy or an ally alive, or else fail
the mission.  This mod makes those escortees invulnerable, so you no longer
have to worry about inadvertantly failing the mission.  This mod is slightly
less useful than its BL2 counterpart, since most of the escortees in TPS can't
be damaged accidentally by the player, but here it is regardless.

### TPS Mega TimeSaver XL

This mod speeds up nearly all the noticeably-slow interactive objects
that you use throughout TPS by 5x (in general), most notably:

 * Computers / Switches
 * Containers
 * Doors / Gates
 * Fast Travel Stations *(mostly just for after the Felicity Rampant fight)*
 * Grinder
 * Lifts / Elevators / Transporters
 * Oxygen Generators
 * Slot Machines
 * Vehicle Aimations

### TPS Movement Speed Cheats

This mod increases movement speed of all TPS characters (including while
crouched, and while in FFYL).  It also increases the jump height a bit, and
increases air control by quite a lot.  If you're looking to zip through
some levels like there's no tomorrow, this is for you.

### TPS No Wasted COMs

*(Included as an optional selection in TPS UCP 2.2 - no need to use this
one separately if you're already using TPS UCP 2.2!)*

This mod changes the Class Mod drop pools such that the only COMs which drop
are for characters who are actually playing the game.  For a singleplayer
game, that means you'll only ever get COMs for your one character, for
instance.

### TPS Red Text Explainer

Inspired by Ezeith's BL2 mod "Red text explainer"

All weapons, grenades, and shields with red text will include text describing
the extra effects.  Class Mods and Oz Kits have been left alone, since all
those list their effects right on the card.

### TPS Skinpool Reassignments

*(Included in TPS UCP 2.2 in the base patch - no need to use this one
separately if you're already using TPS UCP 2.2!)*

This mod serves the same purpose as BL2 UCP's "`Loot Pool & Drop Changes ->
Skinpool Fixes (Don't uncheck this)`" section, but for TPS.  Specifically, it
frees up 624 skin/head pools for use by TPS mods.  This is possible because the
default skin/head pool structure uses an effectively unnecessary intermediate
pool inbetween the pool that's actually used for drops and the skins/heads
themselves.

Mods for Testing Mods
=====================

I've got a separate directory for 

Utilities
=========

Most of the mods in here are constructed programmatically in Python, and
require a utility library stored in my Borderlands 2 directory, `modprocessor.py`.
To generate any of these mods from the master files, you'd have to copy
or symlink that from my BL2 dir.
