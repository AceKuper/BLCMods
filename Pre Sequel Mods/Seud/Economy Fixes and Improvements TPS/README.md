# Economy Fixes and Improvements

*A Borderlands TPS Economy mod*

*(also available for Borderlands 2)*

Ever wished that vendors sold useful items ?

Annoyed by the fact your legendary won't afford you more than two whites in the shop ?

Irritated by the absolute joke that is late game economy ?

Infuriated by the countless quirks of weapon price calculation ?


Then this mod is for you !

Economy Fixes and Improvements (Or EFI) aims to make vending machines an actual source of loot like any other, making shops more than an emergency source of low level weapons and a place to spend your money other than feeding Hyperion New-U stations. The mod includes no less than 6 different individually configurable modules that make Borderlands 2 economy a mechanic instead of a simple flavorful touch.

The mod is balanced to work with all modules together, but they can be individually disabled if you wish (Disabling Fixes is not recommended however)

## Modules

The following modules are available :

- Better Rarity Prices : Makes rarity a bigger factor in weapon prices. Whites and greens are cheaper, while purples and up are more expensive
- Softer Price Curve : Lowers the effect of level on prices, making it less likely to hit the cap
- More Rewarding Quests : A simple module that raises quests cash rewards (XP and other items/currencies are unaffected)
- Change Markup : Set a different markup more adapted with the new prices
- Increase Vendor Item Quality : Allows vending machines to sell better quality items
- Increase Vendor Item Quantity : Increases the amount of items sold by vendors
- Fixed Death Penalty : Deaths cost a fixed amount of money scaling with level rather than ~14% of your currency

## Economy Fixes Only

More of a modders resource than anything, this file contains only fixes for how prices for items are calculated. It is already included in EFI, but if you're a modder who wants to mod the economy without spending hours tracking all the inconsistent weapon parts, you may use it freely as a base (Just credit me !)
