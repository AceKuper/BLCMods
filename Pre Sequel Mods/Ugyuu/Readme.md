# Ugyuu's Pre-Sequel Creations

Hello! Here you will find some of my first ever mods.

All mods have been updated as of August 20th 2019, apart from the Perses. The COM Overhaul has been made compatible with BLCMM, but nothing else has been changed.. yet.

**Note for newcomers: My mods are usually slightly stronger than normal but not broken OP. I prefer this over underpowered weapons.**

Thank you for stopping by! Message me on Discord if you have any questions about my mods. I appreciate feedback / criticism! ugyuu#3473

Did you know that my UI Font Mod works for Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel as well? [Click here to check it out!](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Ugyuu/JPN%20UI%20Font)
